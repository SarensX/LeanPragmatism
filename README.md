Agile ~~framework~~ without the fuzz.
Just a mindset. No training required. No certification required. No badges given.

## One Value: Delivered Value

In the world of Lean Pragmatism, our core value is simple yet profound: Add Value. Every action, decision, and iteration should contribute meaningfully to the desired outcomes. We believe in cutting through the noise and focusing on what truly matters—adding value at every step. By emphasizing this value, we ensure that our efforts are purposeful, impactful, and aligned with the goals we aim to achieve.

## One Principle: Do it, as long as you can handle it and it creates value.

At Lean Pragmatism, we embrace the principle of Just Do It. No overthinking, no unnecessary delays—just take action. When faced with a challenge or question, our approach is to act swiftly and decisively. This principle embodies the spirit of getting things done, encouraging a proactive mindset that drives progress. By 'Just Doing It,' we foster a culture of initiative, empowerment, and continuous improvement.

## The Story of Lean Pragmatism

We are Stephan & Joachim. We've dedicated ourselves to living and teaching Scrum, SAFe, and fostering an agile mindset. But we've noticed something troubling: amidst the sea of frameworks and certifications, the true essence of agility often gets lost.

We've seen teams struggle to adopt frameworks without embracing the agile mindset. One weekend, we found ourselves driving across Europe to help unblock a team. As we reflected during our journey over a beer, we thought about how the actual core mindset of agile seems to be forgotten too often.

And that's how Lean Pragmatism was born—a way to keep agility alive in a world of frameworks and dogmas.

First, understand and adopt the mindset. Only then, frameworks will really help you to scale and grow.
