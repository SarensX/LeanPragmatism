          The Story of Lean Pragmatism
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are Stephan & Joachim. We've dedicated ourselves to living and teaching Scrum, SAFe, and fostering an agile mindset. But we've noticed something troubling: amidst the sea of frameworks and certifications, the true essence of agility often gets lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've seen teams struggle to adopt frameworks without embracing the agile mindset. One weekend, we found ourselves driving across Europe to help unblock a team. As we reflected during our journey over a beer, we thought about how the actual core mindset of agile seems to be forgotten too often.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's how Lean Pragmatism was bornâ€”a way to keep agility alive in a world of frameworks and dogmas.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, understand and adopt the mindset. Only then, frameworks will really help you to scale and grow.
